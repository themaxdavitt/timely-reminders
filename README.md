# timely-reminders

Here lies "timely-reminders". It both solved a problem I had (not drinking enough water or standing up often enough when working during the day) and was a fun way to learn more about [fly.io](https://fly.io) (an interesting cloud hosting startup I had read a lot about). It served its job well, may it rest in piece.

Eh, maybe I'll resurrect it someday, who knows. :)
