# timely-reminders

Here lies "timely-reminders". It's [`crond`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) packaged as a [Fly.io](https://fly.io) app with scripts to send me push notifications using [Pushover](https://pushover.net). It both solved a problem I had (not drinking enough water or standing up often enough when working during the day) and was a fun way to learn more about Fly.io (an interesting cloud hosting startup I had read a lot about previously). It served its job well, may it rest in piece.

Eh, maybe I'll resurrect it someday, who knows. :)
